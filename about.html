            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                My name is Robert and I am 44 years old. I first started to ride motocross when I was only six years old. 
                However I stoped when I became a teenager. Several years later, at the age of 33, I started to ride again. 
                This time with a lot of passion for the sport. I started to ride both motocross and enduro. I practied hard 
                after a couple of years I dared to enter a competition. It was actually an endur race. Later that year I also 
                participated in motocross competitions. Is just on an amatuer level, but in about three yeas I managed to 
                progress from class D to class B. Almost made it to class A a couple of races. Sadly for about two years ago 
                I started to get really sick because of a chronical liver disease. In the spring of 2023 I went through a 
                liver transplantation and started rehab. In the start of August I was back on the dirtbike again, and will 
                start to train for the amatuer races again. My goal is to reach class A.

            <h2>Motocross vs. Enduro</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                The main different between the sports is that motocross is on a track with a everyone starting behind a start gate. 
                Enduro is to ride on marked trails. Usually in a forest, but that can vary a lot. Enduro is mostly longer races and 
                can take a whole day to complete. Some races are even 24h races.<br>
                Another thing that is different is the dirtbike itself. A motocross bike are more rapid in throttle response, 
                are more aggressive to ride and have a stiffer suspension. An enduro can be recognized that is often has a headlight 
                and a break light in the rear. Also common with a horn.
